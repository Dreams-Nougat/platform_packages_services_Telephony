There are IMS stack implementations which rely on the route being via the modem.  I can see how a software-based stack would require the audio-mode to be voip, however.

I think this change is reasonable, but it needs to be gated on a config.xml value which you'd set in your own distribution.

Suggest: use_voip_mode_for_ims
The default config.xml would be false, and you can use a device overlay to override that in your implementation to true.
